Object_Detection.ipynb is fairly straightforward to run. I haven't included the saved models in the zip folder as joblib split them up into hundreds of pieces so you'll need to retrain these again. I can send them seperately if needed. The INRIA directory needs to be located at "lib/INRIAPerson" starting in the same directory as the notebook. The test annotations json should be placed here "lib/INRIAPerson/Test/inria_annotations.json". You should be able to run the whole notebook through wihtout any problems. If you ever want to retrain the models saved on disk you need to set train_new=True on fit_custom() or predict_prob(), otherwise it will always load the existing models first from disk, then from memory. I'm running my models with opencv .
